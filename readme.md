# THE ODIN PROJECT 

 The goal of this project is to document my progression in web development and create detailed notes along the way.


## Web Development 101 - How does the internet work?

### 1. Describe what the internet is. - 
- The internet is a world wide network of linked computers. Each of these computers can communicate with each other in a specific format.

### 2. Describe what packets are and how they are used to transfer data.
- Packets are the information of the internet. Packets are sent from the sender to the receiver in a specific format that contains all the information needed to communicate.

### 3. Understand the differences between a web page, web server, web browser and search engine.
